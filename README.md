# Memory Weave

## Overview
**Memory Weave** is an innovative project that transforms a video stream into an interactive timeline with checkpoints. Each checkpoint represents a significant moment in the video, and hovering over it reveals a placard containing:
- A snapshot of that moment.
- The action that triggered the event (e.g., sitting down, standing up, turning left, turning right).
- A description of the moment, generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) based on the detected objects and actions.

The system allows you to provide a **system prompt** describing the event you are attending (e.g., a meeting, a party, a lecture), which helps the LLM generate contextually relevant descriptions.

## Features
1. **Video Stream Breakdown**:
   - Breaks down a video stream into a timeline with checkpoints.
   - Each checkpoint corresponds to a significant moment in the video.

2. **Interactive Placards**:
   - Hover over a checkpoint to see:
     - A snapshot of the moment.
     - The action that triggered the event.
     - A description of the moment generated by the LLM.

3. **System Prompt**:
   - Provide a system prompt describing the event (e.g., "This is a lecture on AI ethics").
   - The LLM uses this context to generate meaningful descriptions.

4. **Object and Action Detection**:
   - Passes a list of detected objects and actions to the LLM for generating descriptions.

5. **Customizable**:
   - Easily integrate with different video streams and LLMs.
   - Customize the system prompt and event context.

## How It Works
1. **Video Input**:
   - The system takes a video stream as input.

2. **Object and Action Detection**:
   - Detects objects and actions in the video using a pre-trained model (e.g., YOLO, OpenPose).

3. **Timeline Creation**:
   - Breaks the video into a timeline with checkpoints at significant moments.

4. **LLM Integration**:
   - Passes the detected objects, actions, and system prompt to the LLM.
   - The LLM generates a description for each moment.

5. **Interactive Display**:
   - Displays the timeline with hoverable checkpoints.
   - Each checkpoint shows a placard with a snapshot, action, and description.

## Example Use Case
### System Prompt:
```
This is a lecture on AI ethics. The speaker is discussing the importance of fairness in AI systems.
```

### Detected Objects and Actions:
- **Objects**: Person, chair, table, laptop.
- **Actions**: Sitting down, standing up, turning left, turning right.

### Generated Placard:
- **Snapshot**: Image of the speaker sitting at the table.
- **Action**: Sitting down.
- **Description**: "The speaker sits down at the table to begin the lecture on AI ethics. They open their laptop and start discussing the importance of fairness in AI systems."

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/memory-weave.git
   cd memory-weave
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the LLM:
   - Configure the LLM API key in `config.py`.

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

## Configuration
- **System Prompt**: Edit the `system_prompt.txt` file to describe the event.
- **LLM API Key**: Add your LLM API key in `config.py`.
- **Video Source**: Specify the video stream source in `config.py`.

---

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- YOLO (or another object detection model)
- LLM API (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Hugging Face)
- Flask (for the web interface)

---

## Future Enhancements
1. **Real-Time Processing**:
   - Enable real-time video stream processing for live events.

2. **Multi-Language Support**:
   - Generate descriptions in multiple languages.

3. **Customizable Placards**:
   - Allow users to customize the appearance of placards.

4. **Export Timeline**:
   - Export the timeline as a PDF or interactive webpage.
